# Scratch To Unity
 A website that converts your entire Scratch project into a Unity project.

# What it supports
 - lists
 - variables
 - all operators
 - motion blocks
 - almost all control blocks
 - custom blocks
 - layers
 - scaling, rotation, hiding
 - messages
 - SVG / PNG costumes
 - async / sync scripts (asyc by default, but sync if the custom block is a warp block) this ensure all projects to run at the same framerate as scratch
 - some sensing blocks

The converter actually supports 95 different blocks
