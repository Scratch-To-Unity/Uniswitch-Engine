# What it can do
The converter actually supports 99 different blocks such as :
 - motion blocks
 - scaling, rotation, hiding
 - layers
 - costumes
 - messages
 - control blocks
 - clones
 - some sensing blocks
 - all operators
 - variables
 - lists
 - custom blocks
 - Pen / stamping
 - SVG / PNG costumes
 - async / sync scripts (async by default, but sync if the custom block is a warp block) this ensure all projects to run at the same framerate as scratch
